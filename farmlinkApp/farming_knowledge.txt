Crop Farming in Kenya:
1. Maize is the staple food crop in Kenya. It grows best in areas with rainfall of 500-800mm and well-drained loamy soils. The main planting seasons are March-May (long rains) and October-December (short rains).
2. Beans grow well in moderate climates with rainfall of 400-600mm. They are often intercropped with maize to improve soil fertility.
3. Irish potatoes thrive in cool highland areas such as Meru, Nyandarua, and Nakuru. They require well-drained fertile soils and grow well in altitudes above 1,800 meters.
4. Tomatoes require warm temperatures and good irrigation. Drip irrigation is especially useful in dry areas like Machakos and Makueni.
5. Sukuma wiki (collard greens) is a popular vegetable crop. It does well in areas with consistent moisture and responds well to manure and nitrogen fertilizers.

Soil Fertility and Management:
1. Always test your soil before planting to determine pH and nutrient levels. Most crops do well in pH 5.5 to 7.5.
2. Apply farmyard manure to improve organic matter content. Composting is encouraged for sustainability.
3. Rotate crops every season to prevent nutrient depletion and break pest and disease cycles.
4. Use lime to neutralize acidic soils, especially in high rainfall areas like Kisii and Kakamega.

Pest and Disease Control:
1. Maize is affected by fall armyworm; use pheromone traps and timely application of recommended pesticides.
2. Tomatoes suffer from bacterial wilt and blight; use disease-free seedlings and fungicides.
3. Practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM): combine chemical, biological, and cultural methods for pest control.
4. Remove infected plant residues and practice crop rotation to manage soil-borne diseases.

Livestock Farming:
1. Dairy farming is common in Central and Rift Valley regions. Friesian and Ayrshire cows are high milk producers.
2. Vaccinate cattle against East Coast Fever, Anthrax, and Foot and Mouth Disease.
3. Deworm animals every 3 months using broad-spectrum dewormers.
4. Provide adequate housing, clean water, and high-protein feeds like lucerne and calliandra.
5. Poultry farming is a good source of income. Vaccinate chickens against Newcastle disease and fowl pox.

Agroforestry:
1. Plant trees such as grevillea, calliandra, and leucaena on farm boundaries to provide fodder, shade, and firewood.
2. Trees also improve soil fertility and reduce erosion.

Irrigation and Water Management:
1. Use drip irrigation to conserve water in dry areas.
2. Harvest rainwater using tanks and earth dams to irrigate crops during dry spells.
3. Mulch crops to conserve soil moisture and reduce weed growth.

Marketing and Post-Harvest Handling:
1. Dry grains like maize and beans to 13% moisture before storage to avoid aflatoxins.
2. Store grains in airtight containers or metal silos to prevent pest damage.
3. Sell produce through farmer cooperatives and SACCOs to access better prices.
4. Explore contract farming for guaranteed markets.

Government Support:
1. The Kenyan government offers subsidized fertilizer through the e-voucher program.
2. Agricultural extension officers provide training and farm visits for free.
3. Access loans through AFC and local SACCOs for farm inputs.

Climate Smart Agriculture:
1. Use drought-resistant crop varieties to cope with changing climate.
2. Practice conservation agriculture: minimum tillage, cover cropping, and crop rotation.
3. Adopt solar-powered irrigation and biogas systems to reduce costs and carbon emissions.

Common Mistakes to Avoid:
1. Planting late – always follow the seasonal forecast and prepare early.
2. Overuse of fertilizers – leads to soil acidification and nutrient imbalance.
3. Ignoring record keeping – always track input costs, yields, and profits.
4. Selling produce individually – join farmer groups to improve bargaining power.

Record Keeping:
1. Record daily activities: planting, spraying, weeding, harvesting.
2. Keep receipts for all inputs purchased.
3. Track livestock performance: milk yields, births, treatments.

Farming Calendar for Kenya:
- January–February: Land preparation for long rains.
- March–May: Planting of maize, beans, Irish potatoes.
- June–August: Weeding and top dressing.
- September: Harvesting of early crops, land prep for short rains.
- October–December: Planting for short rains, irrigation, pest control.
